          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Hyacinth is the main focus of this directory and acts as a progenitor of more or less everything else found within. As a character, Hyacinth has existed in separate incarnations depending on the exact world/timeline they are apart of. As such, their exact origin and biology can change, being massaged to fit the setting. The contents of this directory will mostly stick to information that is reliably true across all canons the character has appeared in, but keep in mind that most details are negotiable to help them fit into the setting. If details are irreconcilable or otherwise conflict with each other, discussions of conflicting events will occur as their own distinct paragraphs with the prefix point "DC:" (short for DisContinuity).</p>
          <p>Hyacinth is a roughly 8' 10" equid creature. Originally, Hyacinth was a normal equine, but a traumatic event at some point in their past has resulted in them developing into an equine-adjacent mutant (occasionally refered to as an Equid Abomination). This mutation has lead to them developing powerful psionic abilities (more on that later), including their spawning of flesh puppets when placed under intense duress (for example, extreme acute stress, or physical injury).</p>
          <p><b>DC:</b> Depending on the timeline, the exact nature of the event that triggered Hyacinth's mutation. Two significant versions of events are:<br> - As a young teen, they were deliberately made into a testbed for numerous technologies, including the rapid gestation of soldiers.<br> - They were taken from a farm near the end of their life, and subsequently mutated into an Abomination for use as a mobile invasion force.</p>
          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>Hyacinth is overall a very gentle and motherly sort of figure, both to their puppets and others around them. Despite their appearance and circumstances, they are generally a terminal optimist, with an overall positive outlook on life. They love their puppets, whom they typically refer to as their children (or grandchildren in the case of subpuppets), and the presence of the puppets brings them a significant amount of joy. This contentment generally leads to them living a pleasant, settled life (though not necessarily quiet, given how many puppets they keep around).</p>
          <p>Hyacinth usually ends up living as some sort of grain farmer (typically flax, but triticale is also a plausible outcome). All of their puppets assist them in these endeavours, acting as farmhooves, planners, growers, and providing magical assistance. This results in them generally having an overabundance of food, because they typically have little better to do than just consistently work the farm.</p>
          <h2>Skills and Abilities</h2>
          <p>Hyacinth has a wide variety of abilities due to their mutated nature, with a wealth of physical, psionic, and magical capabilities. In general, they lean towards the end of supporting others rather than directly attacking themselves, however they are still generally found in the frontline due to their large size and the benefits they get from being injured.</p>
          <div><h3>Durability and Physical Strength</h3></div>
          <p>Hyacinth is a considerably durable creature, even considering their size. Attacks that would destroy normal creatures their size will only scratch them or make them stagger. Their durability is multi-fold: They have thick hide, dense bones, accelerated natural regeneration, and they have a number of redundant organs, meaning that even if a blow lands someplace that would normally be vital, it's not necessarily the end for them.</p>
          <p>In addition to their defensive brawn, Hyacinth isn't weak offensively, either. Their single hand permits them some tool and weapon use, and while their legs are most often occupied with supporting their body mass, they are powerful when push comes to shove. And, of course, the large natural flange mace on their third arm is the star of the show in the physical brawling department; weighing over fifty pounds and mounted on a double-elbowed joint, the mace is a brutal weapon against even heavily armored opponents.</p>
          <div><h3>Magical Capabilities</h3></div>
          <p>Hyacinth's magic errs largely on the support and healing side, though they do possess some basic combat magics that are passed on from their magical puppets; <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/tricksters">Tricksters</a> especially. Below is a rough list of their general magical abilities:</p>
          <p>- Magic Hands: Hyacinth's levitation magic comes in the form of numerous shimmering magical hands, which are capable of bearing a significant amount of weight. Despite the apparent strength of these hands, Hyacinth never uses them for attacking.</p>
          <p>- Healing Magic: Hyacinth is capable of powerful healing magic; treating wounds of varying grievousness, curing diseases, and even reviving the deceased if the body is particularly fresh and they have some Tricksters around to help with magic. Generally, wounds in softer tissue are the easiest for them to treat.</p>
          <p>- Arcane Projectiles: Hyacinth can conjure arcane projectiles of varying size and function, particularly bolts of light in smallish-medium sizes, that either simply do damage or leave targets marked for their puppets or other attacks to follow.</p>
          <p>- Healing Aura: Like <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a>, Hyacinth radiates a faint healing aura into their environment at all times. This healing energy isn't strong enough to passively affect most normal creatures, but allows puppets standing within a generous 30 feet of them to slowly recover from wounds and other ills.</p>
          <div><h3>Psionics</h3></div>
          <p>Psionics are a class of ability that relate to Hyacinth's brainpower and bodily anatomy. While their puppets use psionics in other ways, Hyacinth largely uses theirs to sustain their puppets through a process of Neural Patterning. Neural Patterns allow Hyacinth to coordinate the similar body rhythms of different puppet types, meaning they can spawn many of the same puppet type with minimal onloading of mental strain, as Hyacinth only has to worry about managing the nervous impulses for things like moving. Breathing, digestion, heart pumping, and other relatively constant bodily processes can be comfortably patterned across the same few sections of brain cells, meaning the only thing that meaningfully increases strain is new puppet types.</p>
          <p>The exact amount of brain cell use varies by caste, and is generally split into categories of 1x use, 2x use, and 4x use. The categories are Light, Heavy, and Superheavy respectively, and more information on them can be found on the <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/">Puppets</a> page.</p>

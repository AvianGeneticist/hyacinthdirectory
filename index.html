          <p>Hyacinth is the main focus of this directory and acts as a progenitor of more or less everything else found within. As a character, Hyacinth has existed in separate incarnations depending on the exact world/timeline they are apart of. As such, their exact origin and biology can change, being massaged to fit the setting. The contents of this directory will mostly stick to information that is reliably true across all canons the character has appeared in, but keep in mind that most details are negotiable to help them fit into the setting. If details are irreconcilable or otherwise conflict with each other, discussions of conflicting events will occur as their own distinct paragraphs with the prefix point "DC:" (short for DisContinuity)</p>
          <p>Hyacinth is a roughly 8' 10" equid creature. Originally, Hyacinth was a normal equine, but a traumatic event at some point in their past has resulted in them developing into an equine-adjacent mutant (occasionally refered to as an Equid Abomination). This mutation has lead to them developing powerful psionic abilities (more on that later), including their spawning of flesh puppets when placed under intense duress (for example, extreme acute stress, or physical injury).</p>
          <p><b>DC:</b> Depending on the timeline, the exact nature of the event that triggered Hyacinth's as mutation. Two significant versions of events are:<br> - As a young teen, they were deliberately made into a testbed for numerous technologies, including the rapid gestation of soldiers.<br> - They were taken from a farm near the end of their life, and subsequently mutated into an Abomination for use as a mobile invasion force.</p>

          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Hyacinth is the main focus of this directory and acts as a progenitor of more or less everything else found within. As a character, Hyacinth has existed in separate incarnations depending on the exact world/timeline they are apart of. As such, their exact origin and biology can change, being massaged to fit the setting. The contents of this directory will mostly stick to information that is reliably true across all canons the character has appeared in, but keep in mind that most details are negotiable to help them fit into the setting. If details are irreconcilable or otherwise conflict with each other, discussions of conflicting events will occur as their own distinct paragraphs with the prefix point "DC:" (short for DisContinuity).</p>
          <p>Hyacinth is a roughly 8' 10" equid creature. Originally, Hyacinth was a normal equine, but a traumatic event at some point in their past has resulted in them developing into an equine-adjacent mutant (occasionally refered to as an Equid Abomination). This mutation has lead to them developing powerful psionic abilities (more on that later), including their spawning of flesh puppets when placed under intense duress (for example, extreme acute stress, or physical injury).</p>
          <p><b>DC:</b> Depending on the timeline, the exact nature of the event that triggered Hyacinth's mutation. Two significant versions of events are:<br> - As a young teen, they were deliberately made into a testbed for numerous technologies, including the rapid gestation of soldiers.<br> - They were taken from a farm near the end of their life, and subsequently mutated into an Abomination for use as a mobile invasion force.</p>
          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>Hyacinth is overall a very gentle and motherly sort of figure, both to their puppets and others around them. Despite their appearance and circumstances, they are generally a terminal optimist, with an overall positive outlook on life. They love their puppets, whom they typically refer to as their children (or grandchildren in the case of subpuppets), and the presence of the puppets brings them a significant amount of joy. This contentment generally leads to them living a content, settled life (though not necessarily quiet, given how many puppets they keep around).</p>
          <p>Hyacinth usually ends up living as some sort of grain farmer (typically flax, but triticale is also a plausible outcome). All of their puppets assist them in these endeavours, acting as farmhooves, planners, growers, and providing magical assistance. This results in them generally having an overabundance of food, because they typically have little better to do than just consistently work the farm.</p>
          <h2>Skills and Abilities</h2>
          <p>Hyacinth controls and their puppets through a mechanism known as psionics. Psionics are a tricky field; they appear similar to magic on the surface, but utilize Hyacinth's biological brain capacity. There seems to be a genetic component as well, as their psionic power waxes and wanes depending on a few different factors. In some timelines, it is virtually unlimited. Each puppet uses a certain amount of brainpower channeled through psionics, which is a phenomenon generally known as "psionic weight". More information on puppet weight classes can be found in the <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/">Puppet page</a>.</p>
          <p>In addition to the diverse army of puppets at their disposal, Hyacinth has their own array of strengths and abilities at their disposal. At their most basic, Hyacinth is extremely durable, surviving attacks that would kill most with relative ease. Their array of limbs includes a large flange mace, giving them a potent attack in close quarters. And, of course, they have not one, but two unicorn horns to cast magic with, though their magic is largely confined to healing magics of varying power, in addition to telekinesis by way of magic hands.</p>

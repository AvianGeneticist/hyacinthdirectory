          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Tricksters fulfill the role of light magicians in Hyacinth's army, specializing in lightweight magics with low cost and limited casting times. They are generally the third most common puppet type, after <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/manipulators">Manipulators</a> and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/imps">Imps</a>. A group of Tricksters is known as a party.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Tricksters are small-ish puppets, standing at an average height of 3' 0" (91cm) with a fairly average build. Their defining trait is the unicorn horn the comes from their forehead. The fact this horn is their only defining trait often leads to Tricksters being mistaken for normal unicorns at a distance. Tricksters are not especially interesting internally, but they do tend to have abnormally high blood sugar levels, which drop in extended periods of combat. This suggests that their magic power is at least partially caloric in origin. In addition to their magical potential, Tricksters display very limited psionic potential, which is believed to be most active during their communal casting.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>In combat, Tricksters can be seen swarming the battlefield with a variety of low- to middling-intensity spells. These spells generally include projectiles of various sorts, manipulatable spikes for traps or volley attacks, and more tactical spells like magic hands for picking things up or dragging them around. Despite their ability to create hands out of magic, Tricksters rarely ever use tools; there is disagreement over whether this is an inability, an active disdain, or a simple absentminded ignorance.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Tricksters display a very playful and occasionally troublemaking streak, using low-intensity magic spells to make visual or audible disturbances with the intent to startle or tease other puppets. While they don't display a strong preference in their targets, their usual favourites seem to be Praetors, and their least favourites seem to be <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/deltas">Deltas</a>. Curiously, a Reconcilant may spawn when startled by a particularly sneaky Trickster, suggesting this behaviour is at least partially rooted in propagation of other puppets.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>At the genetic level, Tricksters share an unsurprising amount of epigenetic triggers with Totems. Given they are both magical castes, it is generally agreed that it would be more surprising if they were not related. Tricksters overall have very few epigenetic surprises; they share most of the common triggers with other light puppets, but that is about it. An occasional joke is that "they must surprise others in non-genetic ways; thus their attempts at tricks".</p>
          <p>Tricksters do have one particular peculiarity. A Trickster can be "hot" or "cold", corresponding with a slight increase or decrease in body temperature (respectively), and the ability to cast bolts of fire or beams of frost (also respectively). More surprisingly, Tricksters can occasionally change between these triggers. Some believe that this resilience to internal temperature change (and the readiness to switch to it) is the uptick to the Tricksters' overall lower durability, though the fact that they are more durable than Deltas generally offsets this claim.</p>
          <div><h2>Known Spells</h2></div>
          <p>Because Tricksters display a variety of spells, with distinct spellcasting compared to Totems, their observed spells are listed here for convenience:<br> - Arcane Slivers: Needles of raw magic that are spawned in significant numbers, and then either passed to allies or thrown directly as an attack.<br> - Magic Missiles: A volley of larger, raw magic projectiles, with high accuracy and magical tracking.<br> - Guiding Bolt: A strong bolt of light magic that leaves a clinging light on the target, illuminating it both physically and magically.<br> - Fire Bolt: Exclusive to "Hot Tricksters". A fiery projectile that produces a small explosion upon impact.<br> - Frost Beam: Exclusive to "Cold Tricksters". A narrow beam of icy magic that leaves its target chilled and sluggish.<br> - Shield: A magical bubble shield that briefly protects the Trickster from physical and magical attacks.<br> - Magic Hand: A Trickster's form of psychokinesis. Does not posess the force needed to reliably attack.<br> - Disturbance: The collection of visual and auditory disturbances Tricksters use to prank their fellows.</p>

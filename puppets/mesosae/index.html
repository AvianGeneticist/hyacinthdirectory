          <p>Mesosae are a heavy puppets covered in a thick layer of precipitation that they can freely manipulate the size and consistency of, allowing them to protect other puppets and return attacks with shards of ice. A group of Mesosae is called a blizzard or a flurry.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are on the smaller side for a heavy puppet, standing at 4' 10" (147cm), though they do have a fairly chunky build (though not as heavyset as <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a>). Mesosae appear much bulkier during peacetime, however, due to their compressible layer of moisture known as a squall. Taking the appearance of a shiny white coat of snow when compressed, Mesosae are in complete control of their squalls' size, shape, and properties. When fully expanded, a Mesosa's squall can stretch into a cylinder about 30 feet in diameter and 25 feet in height. They can also adjust the viscosity, ranging from airy nonpresence to making it almost mudlike in consistency. Internally, Mesosae sport a robust layer of subdermal fat over most of their body, resembling the blubber layers of certain arctic creatures.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are chosen defenders in combat, protecting other nearby puppets a thick veil of mist made out of their uncompressed squall. Other allied puppets and subpuppets originating from the same host can see through this mist without issue, and on more than one occasion, outside allies have been known to have been granted clear sight through the veil as well. A Mesosa can directly respond to incoming attackers and attacks in a variety of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Melee attackers attempting to traverse within the Mesosa's squall will be rapidly inundated with ice and slush as more of the Mesosa's squall accumulates around them, eventually turning into hard shards of ice that dig into the would-be attacker.</li>
            <li>Physical projectiles are rapidly siezed and dragged to a halt, with the icy buildup responsible for the slow subsequently shattering and flying outwards, back in the direction of where the attack came. The larger and faster the projectile, the more shards are returned to the sender.</li>
            <li>Magical attacks are rapidly discharged while inside a Mesosa's squall, the discharged energy sparking the formation of ice shards that fire off in the direction of the original sender. Stronger magical attacks yield more shards, often in a wilder spray.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A Mesosa's energy is limited, however, and the misty veil will begin to shrink and eventually dissipate completely if it absorbs too much punishment. Without their squalls, Mesosae are similar to Reconcilants, minus the ability to spawn, and some innate bodily durability. A Mesosa's squall will replenish over time, though if completely knocked down it can take a significant amount of time to come back.</p>
          <p>During peacetime, Mesosae sport an unusual behaviour for most puppets: They seek out and drink significant quantities of water, particularly if their squalls have been recently depleted. Mesosae exhibit uncomfortable behaviour without their squalls, and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/deltas">Deltas</a> are prone to shielding unsqualled Mesosae even if no threats are present. <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/praetors">Praetors</a> have been observed protecting squalless Mesosae as well.</p>
          <p>When their squalls are not depleted or regenerating, Mesosae are very kindred and playful creatures. Smaller puppets left idle will occasionally gather around a resting Mesosa, building snowsculptures out of the Mesosa's squall (much to the Mesosa's delight). A Mesosa will occasionally cover a fellow puppet's eyes with its squall, before pulling them into a hug. On hot days, Mesosa will expand their squalls into mist even during peacetime, providing a cool veil of shade and cold air for their fellows.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are quite radically different to most puppets, sporting several genes corresponding to traits that are only active not in equines, but in artic regional bovines such as bison. How they unlock these genes is hard to say, though given their snowy coating and icy magic, the reasoning is self-evident. Mesosae are otherwise only distantly related to Reconcilants, and otherwise have no significant connection to any other puppet type.</p>
          <div><h2>Metanarrative</h2></div>
          <p>The Mesosa is a weird puppet type that was added completely outside of a game design context. They were added as a response to the realization that there weren't really any frontline support puppets; Deltas supported from the rear and of course magic can do some fun things, but in terms of a dedicated tank there really weren't any puppets in such a role. As such, Mesosae were introduced as a twist on the classical tank; they radiate an aura of protection via their squalls, which they use to protect allies nearby as heavy frontliners. They also helped me get closer to my goal of having a puppet for every DnD damage type (sorry <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/tricksters">Cold Tricksters</a>, I love you very much but you're not really ice-themed).</p>

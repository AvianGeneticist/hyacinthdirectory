          <p>Mesosae are a heavy puppets covered in a thick layer of precipitation that they can freely manipulate the size and consistency of, allowing them to protect other puppets and return attacks with shards of ice. A group of Mesosae is called a blizzard or a flurry.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are on the smaller side for a heavy puppet, standing at 4' 10" (147cm), though they do have a fairly chunky build (though not as heavyset as <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a>). Mesosae appear much bulkier during peacetime, however, due to their compressible layer of moisture known as a squall. Taking the appearance of a shiny white coat of snow when compressed, Mesosae are in complete control of their squalls' size, shape, and properties. When fully expanded, a Mesosa's squall can stretch into a cylinder about 30 feet in diameter and 25 feet in height. They can also adjust the viscosity, ranging from airy nonpresence to making it almost mudlike in consistency. Internally, Mesosae sport a robust layer of subdermal fat over most of their body, resembling the blubber layers of certain arctic creatures.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are chosen defenders in combat, protecting other nearby puppets a thick veil of mist made out of their uncompressed squall. Other allied puppets and subpuppets originating from the same host can see through this mist without issue, and on more than one occasion, outside allies have been known to have been granted clear sight through the veil as well. Attackers attempting to brave the veil to engage their targets directly will coated and bogged down with ice and slush, slowing their movements. Physical projectiles receive similar treatment, being caught by the mist and slowed to harmless speeds. Magical projectiles will be actively dissipated. Regardless of the method of attack, attacks absorbed by the mist will be reciprocated with sharp shards of ice (either an attack directed at a melee attacker within the mist, or shot out of the veil back towards the source of the projectile). The intensity of the frosty rebuke is seemingly proportional to the severity of the attack coming in.</p>
          <p>A Mesosa's energy is limited, however, and the misty veil will begin to shrink and eventually dissipate completely if it absorbs too much punishment. Without their squalls, Mesosae are similar to Reconcilants, minus the ability to spawn, and some innate bodily durability. A Mesosa's squall will replenish over time, though if completely knocked down it can take a significant amount of time to come back.</p>
          <p>During peacetime, Mesosae sport an unusual behaviour for most puppets: They seek out and drink significant quantities of water, particularly if their squalls have been recently depleted. Mesosae exhibit uncomfortable behaviour without their squalls, and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/deltas">Deltas</a> are prone to shielding unsqualled Mesosae even if no threats are present. <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/praetors">Praetors</a> have been observed protecting squalless Mesosae as well.</p>
          <p>When their squalls are not depleted or regenerating, Mesosae are very kindred and playful creatures. Smaller puppets left idle will occasionally gather around a resting Mesosa, building snowsculptures out of the Mesosa's squall (much to the Mesosa's delight). A Mesosa will occasionally cover a fellow puppet's eyes with its squall, before pulling them into a hug. On hot days, Mesosa will expand their squalls into mist even during peacetime, providing a cool veil of shade and cold air for their fellows.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Mesosae are quite radically different to most puppets, sporting several genes corresponding to traits that are only active not in equines, but in artic regional bovines such as bison. How they unlock these genes is hard to say, though given their snowy coating and icy magic, the reasoning is self-evident. Mesosae are otherwise only distantly related to Reconcilants, and otherwise have no significant connection to any other puppet type.</p>

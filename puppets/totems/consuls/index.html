          <p>Brokers are a type of lightning elemental that have been adapted for use with Hyacinth's psionic network. Conjured by <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems">Totems</a>, they are heavy brutalists that shape their spawned <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems/consuls/agents">Agents</a> into powerful midranged lashes and flails.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Consuls are the heaviest elemental by far, standing at roughly 6' 2" (188cm) with heavy builds. This size makes them slightly bigger than the Totems that conjure them, making them relatively unique among other puppet types in that regard. The reason for this size is evident, however, with Consuls taking direct, obvious inspiration from <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a> in both form and function. Other than their size and Reconcilant-inspired side head, Consuls sport long, wiry whiskers extending from their face, and consistently have small arcs of electricity running along them; particularly between their six legs.</p>
          <p>Consuls actually have some noticeable physicality to them, with the architecture necessary to spawn. Though this physicality clearly gets use, it's not entirely certain where it comes from. Some believe it's due to the normally violent and unbound nature of electricity, whereas others assume it is a deliberate alteration on behalf of the Totems to make them better fit into a puppet clan.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Consuls act almost like a strange mix between a Reconcilant and a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/praetors">Praetor</a> in battle, prefering to take frontline roles and leveraging elongated electric whips or flails made of their spawned Agents. While they can launch arcs of electricity from their hooves without any Agents, a Consul will always try to have at least one Agent spawned, putting itself in harm's way to encourage a spawn-worthy hit. Unlike Reconcilants, however, Consuls appear to have a maximum amount of Agents, with a single Consul never exceeding nine spawned Agents.</p>
          <p>Consuls have free reign to manipulate their Agents how they like, forming them into segmented shapes. Regardless of the shape, the average segment is about 20 feet long at full stretch, and when swung have a semi-corporeal nature, allowing them to whip through multiple targets without interception. Different shapes have different names and properties:<br> - Lashes: A default lash, formed from a single Agent. An extended chain of Agents can make for a substantially long lash, capable of broad, sweeping strikes.<br> - Lassos: Formed at the end of a branch by two Agents feeding into one another. The Agents have free control over their stretch, working with their host to bind and reel in lassoed targets.<br> - Joints: A lash with more than one Agent connected to itself, forming a tail o' multiple cats-style whip. There is no limit on how many lashes can extend from a joint, though the most popular configuration seems to be three lashes of two Agents' length.<br> - Flails: Formed by three Agents clumping tightly together into a ball of bodies. The end of a flail is encased in a thick ball of electricity that explodes on impact with enemies, releasing an immense wave of energy that stretches for multiple feet. Flails are always the end of a branch, though it is not entirely unlikely that two appear on the end of a branched Joint.</p>
          <p>Consuls are electrical elementals that heal and recover energy from the presence of strong electric currents. Being struck by an <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/arrays">Array's</a> lightning in particular can restore them to full strength in as little as a single attack (assuming enough Arrays contribute to the blast), and will often make them spawn two or three Agents at once if they are lacking.</p>
          <p>Consuls are diligent and slightly militant puppets, spending their idle time experimenting with their Agents to find optimal shapes for both labor and combat. They will also check over individual Agents for damage, and will tend to them like artisans maintaining their tools, though they rarely do this with any other sort of puppet or subpuppet.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Consuls are peculiar among elementals in that they have traces of biological material in them, with genomes resembling that of Reconcilants and Arrays in the portions of their body responsible for spawning. Despite this, Consuls have no sort of spawning orifices, and as such it is assumed they conjure material outside of their bodies when creating new Agents.</p>

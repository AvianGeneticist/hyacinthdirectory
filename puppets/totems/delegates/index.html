          <p>Delegates are a type of ice elemental that have been adapted to Hyacinth's psionic network. Conjured by <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems">Totems</a>, they act as offensive support units, with crowd-punching spells that chill, vex, or otherwise hamper the enemy's ability to respond. A group of Delegates is known as (what else) a delegation.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Delegates are fairly small compared to their contemporaries based on height alone, standing at roughly 2' 2" (66cm) with narrower frames. However, they make up for this lack of size by having three distinct bodies, each adorned with sharp, crystal-hard icicles dangling from their manes and snowflake-esque wings on their backs. Their tails, while appearing externally like hairy pony tails, are actually muscled limbs that the collective has control over, enabling precise control over the attacking angles they take while also making them extremely difficult to hit.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Delegates boast a mix of fluid agility and target-debuffing magic. They dance near the front lines of combat, their movements equal parts graceful and unpredictable. It's rare for more than one body to be actively attacking at once, the others acting as magical reserves and supports for optimal firing angles. Delegates boast a few different icy techniques:<br> - Slush Column: A long column of slushy terrain that actively claws at enemies who walk on it, digging into them with flash-freezing spines or quills. <br> - Intense Chill: An attack directed at the bodies of a clump of targets, seizing their muscles with intense, petrifying cold.<br> - Dazzling Aurora: A scintillating screen of colours fills the targets' vision, making it immensely difficult to accurately target attacks. A more intense version of this attack actively imposes structured hallucinations in the targets, potentially making them attack their own allies.</p>
          <p>Delegates are icy beings that thrive in the cold, and dancing around within the veil of a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/mesosae">Mesosa's</a> squall is no exception. Delegates enjoy limited regeneration within such an environment, and most who observe them notice even further improvement in their agility. They can often be found poking their attacking body out of the extreme of the squall, taking a potshot before vanishing back into the mist with lightning speed.</p>
          <p>Those who have seen Delegates in combat sometimes swear they become different creatures in peacetime. Delegates are often quite discoordinated and scatterbrained, each body frequently trying to run off on its own just to be pulled back into the fold with its fellows. They can even occasionally get tangled within each other, with <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/manipulators">Manipulators</a> or other dextrous puppets having to untangle them.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Like other Elementals, Delegates do not have any sort of true genetics; only magical blueprints that they follow. The presence of various slushy and icy patches hints that they have some sort of internal organ structure, though how exactly these sections of distinct precipitate affect their function is scarcely known. Considering a Delegate's typical frailty, most assume these pseudo-organs are both purposeful and fragile.</p>
          <div><h2>Metanarrative</h2></div>
          <p>When designing all the elementals, differentiating them was very important to me. I'd already tried a "sharp" ice-themed puppet in the original designs for the Mesosa, but it didn't work well with Hyacinth's softer, rounded aesthetic. So, a very different direction was chosen, leaning on the artistic (particularly dance-heavy) theming of ice: A "snowflake" of ice elementals, bound at the tail and constantly whirling around one another. This combined with a desire to make a dedicated mezzer to make a very strange puppet type that experimented with polysomaly (no idea if that's a real word or not) that used its agility and unusual form factor for lining up crowd hits before disappearing into the fray.</p>

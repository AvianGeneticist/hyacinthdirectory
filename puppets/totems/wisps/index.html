          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Wisps are coalesced beings of magical energy that act like subpuppets. They are formed when a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems">Totem</a> coalesces six magical spirits together, pooling their magical energy into a more cohesive, stable form.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Wisps are a perplexing type of subpuppet, as they are predominantly made of magical energy with very minor interaction with their host Totem's psionic components. Wisps are also extremely small, standing at just 1' 2", (35cm), with very narrow builds to boot. Wisps are not made of flesh and bone like other subpuppets, but rather a mix of magical and psionic energies. Most who have dared touch one say that their fur feels like fibreglass, and more extensive test shows that their physical body parts (including seemingly superfluous internal organs) are made of psionic energy, similar to a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/deltas">Delta's</a> psionic shields. Visually, Wisps are determined by their glowing golden forms, and the two pairs of dragonfly-esque wings that they use to maneuver.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>While Wisps most often remain near their host Totems and act as magical support, amplifying casted spells and augmenting their effects, Wisps are also fully capable of independent magical combat. They are incapable of physical strikes due to their entirely psionomagical forms, but they can naturally throw chunks of raw magic at enemies within range, and can also unleash a powerful pulse of disorienting light. The effect of the light is peculiar in that even if a creature is blinded or has its eyes closed or covered, the disorientation still works, seemingly targeting the brain directly in a manner similar to a Delta's psionic aggression skills.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Wisps are even more likely to hover near their hosts in preparation for any assistance the host Totem may need with casting spells. A Wisp whose energy is depleted may instead cling to one of its host's tendrils, seemingly feeding off of the host Totem's magical energy (though this does not appear to cause the host Totem any issues). Some observers liken a Totem nursing many Wisps to strings of fairy lights, leading to some colloquially referring to Wisps as "Fairies".</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Wisps are not physical creatures with epigenetic profiles of any sort, but they bare a striking resemblance to classical Will o' the Wisps (where they get their name) and other fictional fae creatures. Their body composition hints at a relationship with Deltas, though no link is truly proveable. The fact Wisps have replica internal organs does hint they originate from some sort of body plan, and different Wisps do share identifiable patterns in their body structure, hints that they are in part biological in nature, leading some to classify them as Elementals or Golems.</p>

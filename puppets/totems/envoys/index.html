          <p>Envoys are a type of fire elemental that have been adapted to connect to Hyacinth's psionic network. They are conjured by <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems">Totems</a>, and act as flankers and minelayers, breaking apart enemy fronts while being respectably durable in their own right. A group of Envoys is known as a cluster.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Envoys are quite large on the scale of subpuppets, standing about 5' 4". Their coat is made up of dark brown "stony" regions, with luminescent pink cracks running between them. Their manes are made of flames that can change in colour and intensity depending on their mood, but default to purplish red. Their tails are thick, bulky masses that hang down from their hindquarters. Outside of combat, these tails are just long enough to gently drape along the ground, but they swell to more heavily press upon the ground when a fight breaks out.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Envoys act as frontline support in combat, sporting considerable durability and a variety of fiery magics. They prefer to act as flankers or distractions, operating away from the main contact points. Envoys sport a small handful of different fire magics that they can make use of:<br> - Fire Bolts: Similar to those fired by Hot <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/tricksters">Tricksters</a>, though often lobbed in greater amounts in bursts similar to a shotgun.<br> - Molten Stream: A powerful crowd-punching strike that raises a long line of molten material. The released magma dissipates magically after some time.<br> - Brimstone Mines: An Envoy's bread and butter, taking the form of small mines made of volcanic rock. Laid from the underside of the Envoy's tail, an Envoy can paint a long line of these inconspicuous traps in one go, causing rampant destruction as they're run over.</p>
          <p>Envoys are molten beings and are actively healed by fire and intense heat. As such, they love operating directly under <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/howitzers">Howitzer</a> bombardment, and they will occasionally trigger each other's (or even their own) mines or deliberately catch each other in their area of effect attacks. A cluster of Envoys will often consist of two to four individuals if possible, consistently blowing each other up and getting caught in each others' crossfire.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Envoys are best described as playfully affectionate. They will sneak around other puppets and surprise them with hugs or nuzzles, with Howitzers seemingly being their favourite of their cousins. If multiple Envoys are present, they enjoy coordinating these sorts of surprise affections. Outside of combat, Envoys' natural body heat quells from burning heat to more of an intense, but gentle warmth.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>As magical elementals, Envoys do not take after any sort of puppet genetically. They do not especially resemble any specific puppet on a superficial level, aside from their size suggesting a similar role to heavy puppets. They do have mock organs (generally represented as solid regions inside their otherwise molten bodies), though these appear to serve minimal purpose.</p>

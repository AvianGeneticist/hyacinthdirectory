          <p>Perditioners are titanic puppets capable of immense destruction, from ripping apart landmasses on a macro scale to blasting holes through planets. This power comes at the cost of an immensely long spawn time, as their components must be spawned individually, stored, and eventually assembled by lesser puppets.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Perditioners, among almost all scales of life, are immense, standing at about 55' even (1676cm), with heavy builds. Their blister sacs are merged into a single large "cape" that drapes across their back, protecting their hollow chests which contain their greatest power source. Also of note are their large, dark red ram-like horns, and a crooked tree-like structure on their backs made of a similar material. When using their magic, a large red orb hovers above this back-mounted structure, and many of the Perditioner's most powerful magic attacks originate from it; this orb is known as a Globe.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Perditioners rarely engage in standard combat due to their immense size and power; their attacks, except for a very restrained few, are capable of levelling mountains, boiling oceans, or ripping continents into pieces. Their biggest weakness, despite their inordinate strength, is melee combat; Perditioners are fairly slow in terms of reaction time, and while their hoof-to-hoof attacks are brutal, it is still their greatest weakness. Even exploiting weaknesses, however, Perditioners are still immensely durable; the most reliable way to noticeably injure one is to strike it with cosmological-scale attacks, such as falling asteroids.</p>
          <p>Perditioners are a strange beast at peacetime, given their magic is so immensely powerful. Perditioners will typically find somewhere out of the way of other puppets and avoid approaching others unless approached first. Occasionally, however, their immense magic will be used to rip up floating islands for smaller puppets to live and work on; a task that Perditioners are uniquely capable of, even when sleeping.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Perditioners have some epigenetic triggers in common with other magical puppets like <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/tricksters">Tricksters</a> and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/totems">Totems</a>, as well as many size genes in common with superheavy puppets overall. They also share some extant relation with <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/pustules">Pustules</a>, likely owed to the considerable blister sac mass that forms their top "shell".</p>
          <div><h2>Spellcasting</h2></div>
          <p>Perditioners, while immensely physically strong, are at their strongest when casting magic to manipulate the worlds they wreak havoc upon. These spells are their chosen world-altering tools.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapturous Flare: A Perditioner's weakest attack, taking the form of a large shard of red raw magic. A fairly basic anti-area attack, which hits a relatively small area by Perditioner standards.</li>
            <li>Perdition Beam: A Perditioner's most common attack; a thick beam of immense energy, capable of punching through mountains, fortifications, and even the crusts of smaller planets. Perditioners are at their best firing these off at a distance, carving apart swathes of land and slicing shears of steam through water.</li>
            <li>Ruination Glare: A Perditioner's most powerful direct attack, expulsing as a massive cone of damaging energy fit for scraping across an area, blasting deserts into glass and fields into nothing but wasteland.</li>
            <li>Terramancy: While it is not their primary skill, Perditioners are capable of ripping apart massive chunks of land, tearing landmasses into pieces. A Perditioner trying to destroy things may haul pieces of land up into the path of a beam or glare, or they may simply leave the rubble in their wake. In peacetime, it is this skill that Perditioners use to create floating islands.</li>
            <li>Mantle Manipulation: Perditioners, as a sustained form of attack, can rip open a planet's crust to loose volcanic meteors that they have control over. If the celestial object they are on doesn't have a geologically active mantle, a Perditioner can expend extra energy to liquefy its rocky interior and create one.</li>
            <li>Hydrogenic Compression: If in suitable proximity to a gas giant, a Perditioner can impose an immense amount of artificial energy and pressure onto it, turning it into a brown or (if the gas giant is large enough) red dwarf, releasing a tremendous amount of instantaneous energy as the fusion begins.</li>
          </ul>
          <div><h2>Metanarrative</h2></div>
          <p>Perditioners were never meant to be a "normal" puppet type, as is probably obvious by their stats literally going off the charts. They were one of the few puppets to have a narrative life before any kind of game design one; even the original four had their roots in Cataclismo inspiration and were made accordingly. No, Perditioners were written as a "what if" to the idea of a puppet that was some sort of biblical titan. The idea matured as I wrote about the Earthshapers, a form of magical titanic automata who were in charge of "fixing" the world after great cataclysms. Perditioners arose as the "answer" to the Earthshapers; one great cataclysm to break the great fixers.</p>
          <p>Of course, translating something of "biblical strength" to any kind of quantitative form here is kind of an exercise in futility; I've done my best to write it out here, but I'm sure there's still some left to the imagination. If you've made it this far through all the different puppet entries, thanks for reading. This has been a labor of love (and some frustration with web design) from start to finish, and I'm glad to share my passion for weird, freaky horses with those willing to listen.</p>

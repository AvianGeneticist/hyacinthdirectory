          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Manipulators are best described as the common hoofsoldiers of Hyacinth's armies. They are the most commonly spawned puppet, even among light puppets, and excel in a wide variety of scenarios thanks to their usage of assorted tools, moderate durability, and ample cooperative instinct. Their numbers are rivaled only by <a href="">Imps</a>.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Manipulators are fairly moderately sized puppets at an average height of 3' 6" (or 107cm), with a build that is not notably thick or thin. Their defining trait is their arm, which bears a three fingered hand. It is with this hand that Manipulators conduct a grand majority of their tool usage and other actions. Internally, Manipulators are not anything special, with minimal excess organs. Their brain mass is disproportionnately high, even for a light puppet, but they do not display any sort of psionic or even magical potential. It is assumed that this extra brain mass is used for other functions: tool devising, crafting, and using, as well as cooperating or formulating strategies.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Manipulators display a wide array of behaviours in combat, able to adapt to numerous situations thanks to their usage of tools and weapons. A single Manipulator may engage in combat directly with its hooves, act as a bulwark by equipping a shield, engage targets at range with simple throwing weapons like knapped stone knives, or two Manipulators may "crew up" to act as a coordinated unit, using their combined two hands to wield heavier weapons like crossbows. It is this versatility that gives Manipulators much of their notoriety, as well as their name: They manipulate available resources to their advantage.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Manipulators are prone to a near-stubborn amount of industriousness. They can almost constantly be found attempting to knap stone toolheads, assembling basic tools and weapons, or designing new implements for themselves and their fellows. This industriousness extends to experimenting with multi-unit formations to carry heavy objects just as pieces of machinery.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>At the genetic level, Manipulators display a fairly unique, but wide array of epigenetic triggers that explains a great deal of their versatility. The body has several nerve centers with which to send and receive impulses, suggesting that their versatility is as much neurological as it is physical. The wide variety of triggers also suggests that Manipulators may have once been a more specialized caste, or perhaps evolved into more specialized castes (the inbetweens of which have since been lost to time, or perhaps were skipped entirely through proper genetic maneuvering).</p>

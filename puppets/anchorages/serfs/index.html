          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Serfs act as the working hooves for the buildings built on <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/anchorages">Anchorages</a>. They are not well-suited to combat, but are an excellent workforce.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Serfs are quite small among subpuppets, standing at just 1' 4" (41cm) with slimmer builds. Their defining traits are their five legs, their fly-like insectoid wings, and their single bladed limb in place of what could have once been a sixth leg. Despite superficially resembling Imps, Serfs are not built for combat of any sort, with their bodies being much lighter and simpler. Their blades, while extremely sharp, are best suited for cutting and shaping Haetin. With their tiny builds and nimble five-legged bodies, they are extremely good at their job: Navigating between and inside buildings placed on Anchorages.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Serfs are almost entirely relegated to non-combat roles, but that doesn't mean they don't have a role in combat. They fulfill the roles of supply troops, both crafting new weapons and ammunition and dispersing it as needed. Serfs will even occasionally airlift an injured puppet to the rear battle lines, if the puppet is light enough to be safely carried. If the army is in desperate need of extra hooves on the front lines, Serfs can use their fine-bladed limb as a combat knife, which is more than capable of cutting through hide, skin, and even some lesser-reinforced metal armors like thin chainmail.</p>
          <p>Serfs are generally just as busy outside of combat as they are inside it, constantly buzzing around an Anchorage's buildings (or multiple Anchorages' buildings if a city is formed) to gather materials, craft new items, and store them comfortably. If a Serf needs to rest and its host Anchorage does not have any available housing, it will roost against the underside of one of its Antlers. A single Serf is always spawned as a "twin" with its host Anchorage, making them the only subpuppet to be spawned from Hyacinth directly.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Deltas have an interesting mix of distinct and generic triggers. They share a number of triggers found commonly across other puppet types, but also have a number of triggers found in them and nowhere else. It is generally believed that their powerful psionic abilities are both the beneficiary and explanation of the odd mix of common and rare traits.</p>

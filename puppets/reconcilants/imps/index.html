          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Imps act as extremely lightweight, nimble, disposable swarmers in Hyacinth's army. They come in droves from <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a> to swarm attackers.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Imps are quite small subpuppets, standing at 1' 6" (46cm), with fairly slim, small builds. They sport two major distinguishing traits: Their taloned limbs mimicking a Manipulator's arm, and the bat wings that they are able to use to fly. Internally, their bodies are a bit more complex than normal, but not unusually so; extra skeleton to account for their limbs, and enlarged back muscles for wing movements.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>In combat, Imps have very simple battle strategies; coming from above, Imps swarm their targets and peck at them with taloned limps, pestering and piercing a target until it is able to swat all of them away, or gives out under the onslaught. When paired with a Reconcilant acting as both a meatshield and source of fresh Imps, Imps become a frightening force to be reckoned with.</p>
          <p>With the right fostering, a group of six Imps (no more, no less) can psionically link their bodies. The resulting gestalt is vastly more durable, with the combined durability of all the constituent Imps being pooled between individual bodies. This also has the effect of reducing the effect of area effects, both helpful and harmful. Overall, the boon to durability and coordination is generally considered worth the inflexibility in regards to healing.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Imps are extremely social creatures that commune with both each other and other puppet types, including puppets that are generally asocial like Praetors. Their small bodies allow them to land on top of or under many common puppet types, further facilitating their abilities to flit around and converse.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Imps, contrary to their source Reconcilants, have highly elaborate epigenetic trigger systems. They also have among the most strictly regulated trigger systems as well; likely a necessity to ensure they can fly properly. The keratin that makes up their talons is also uniquely resistant to acid, facilitating a commensialistic interaction with <a src="">Pustules</a>.</p>

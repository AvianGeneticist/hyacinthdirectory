          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Arrays act as light magical attackers, striking targets with coordinated bursts of lightning from their eel-like tails. They are spawned from <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a>.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Arrays are fairly small subpuppets, standing at 1' 8" (51cm), with fairly slim, small builds. Like <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/imps">Imps</a>, they have two major distinguishing features: Their pegasus- or bird-like wings, and their large, spined, eel-like tails that they use to launch electric attacks from. In addition to the expected suite of electrochemical organs for storing and generating electrical charge, Arrays have a specialized piece of their brain not found in any other puppet, seemingly responsible for coordinating</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>While Imps charge forward and break enemies upon their talons, Arrays have a battle strategy that is decidedly a bit more refined: Arrays hang back in loose clumps, forming veins around the battlefield. When the time comes to strike, all Arrays direct their attacks through their network, until the attack is eventually channeled by a final Array into the target. They perform this act with instantaneous precision, and seemingly lossless energy transfer. This tactic has the upside of nearly unparalleled range and flexibility in where the strike lands, but also means a group of Arrays can never strike more than one target in a given cycle.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Arrays behave similarly to Imps, but prefer to keep their social activities amongst themselves; likely due to their conditioning. They do allow Reconcilants to preen them, and this is indeed the only time any puppet displays an explicit wing preening behaviour. Some believe this is evidence that Arrays came later on, and brought necessary behavioural changes with them.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Arrays share epigenetic triggers not with Imps or <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/pustules">Pustules</a>, but <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/deltas">Deltas</a>. Most agree that this relates to the Arrays' ability to commune with supernatural speed, but this does leave questioning as to where the magical component of the lightning comes from. The sheer differential in their body plan from other puppets (sharing a mix of avian and piscine features in addition to equine ones) calls into question the exact role that a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilant</a> has, with some suggesting they act as a genetic mediator to free up genetic real estate within the host.</p>

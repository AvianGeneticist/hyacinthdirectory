          <p>Reconcilants fulfill the role of a light carrier in Hyacinth's army, with the ability to spawn a variety of subpuppets: <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/imps">Imps</a>, <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/arrays">Arrays</a>, and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/pustules">Pustules</a>. A group of Reconcilants is known as a brood or a den.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Reconcilants are considerably-sized puppets, standing at 5' 2" (157cm) with a considerably heavy build; some would go so far as to describe their bodies as closer to cows than horses. Their defining traits are an ancillary head stuck into their side, as well as an orifice in the same side of their torso. Their bodies are riddled with redundant organs as well as spawning architecture and adipose tissue, explaining their substantial bulk. This internal complexity makes them among the most similar to Hyacinth themselves, and this similarity follows through into their role: spawning platforms, for a number of subpuppets. They are the only puppet type to spawn multiple subpuppet types via biological means.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>In combat, Reconcilants use their bulk to get in harm's way in the stead of other puppets. They follow the spawning rules of their parent, and thus, each strike against a Reconcilant's thick hide breeds more subpuppets to further suffuse the battlefield with their presence. This mix of durability and spawning makes them potent combatants, even though their own attacks are rarely anything remarkable.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Reconcilants are generally very sedate. They spend much of their time resting, or grooming their subpuppets or smaller puppets, licking them clean like some animalian parents. This parental behaviour (along with Hyacinth's own) suggests that the Abomination mind is wired to treat puppets as true offspring, despite their somewhat limblike status.</p>
          <p>Occasionally during peacetime, a Reconcilant will volunteer itself seemingly as a punching bag for other puppets. This behaviour is extremely common in Reconcilants who do not have any living subpuppets, and even moreso in Reconcilants who have had subpuppets before but have lost them for whatever reason. The commonality of this behaviour rapidly falls off as the Reconcilant gains more subpuppets, becoming almost entirely nonpresent after as little as three subpuppets.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, if one particular Reconcilant has a vastly greater number of subpuppets than one of its fellows, it will "pass" some of its spawned subpuppets psionically to the lesser-burdened Reconcilant. This behaviour can also occur when a Reconcilant dies; other nearby Reconcilants will "adopt" the deceased Reconcilant's subpuppets, protecting them from the rotting and decohesion that comes from a lack of psionic connection.</p>
          <p>Whether they are in or out of combat, Reconcilants radiate a very faint field of healing energy within a short radius of themselves. This field is too weak to have an effect on most creatures - subpuppets are the exception. Subpuppets near a Reconcilant slowly recover from even grievous wounds.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Reconcilants have a fairly small epigenetic profile, which is generally owed to the wide variety of subpuppets they can spawn. It's believed this limited genetic complexity makes them better hosts, as less triggers have to work against the Reconcilant's own. They do, however, sport significantly above-average stem cell levels, making them more readily able to both heal or spawn at a moment's notice.</p>
          <div><h2>Metanarrative</h2></div>
          <p>Reconcilants are probably the puppet type that've been hurt the most by the passage of time and scopecreep as I add more puppets. They were originally the only heavy puppet, as well as the only puppet type with subpuppets. They were also originally capable of only spawning Imps, leading to Reconcilants being very one-trick ponies (heh). This differentiated them from the other first-generation puppets (<a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/manipulators">Manipulators</a> and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/tricksters">Tricksters</a>), who both sported quite a significant degree of versatility from the get-go.</p>
          <p>Now, granted, all that dev time hasn't gone to waste; Reconcilants now sport their own variety of subpuppets (two lights and a heavy, just like mama when they were young), and they also provide very limited healing magic. This has matured them into a more proper commander-type puppet, which is something I don't ever intend to take from them. There are other puppets with subpuppets, but Reconcilants boast the greatest variety, and are the only puppet type to not have some sort of hard limit on subpuppets; they scale up like Hyacinth does.</p>

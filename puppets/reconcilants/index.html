          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Reconcilants fulfill the role of a light carrier in Hyacinth's army, with the ability to spawn a variety of subpuppets: <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/imps">Imps</a>, <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/arrays">Arrays</a>, and <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants/pustules">Pustules</a>. A group of Reconcilants is known as a brood or a den.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Reconcilants are considerably-sized puppets, standing at 5' 2" (157cm) with a considerably heavy build; some would go so far as to describe their bodies as closer to cows than horses. Their defining traits are an ancillary head stuck into their side, as well as an orifice in the same side of their torso. Their bodies are riddled with redundant organs as well as spawning architecture and adipose tissue, explaining their substantial bulk. This internal complexity makes them among the most similar to Hyacinth themselves, and this similarity follows through into their role: spawning platforms, for a number of subpuppets.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>In combat, Reconcilants use their bulk to get in harm's way in the stead of other puppets. They follow the spawning rules of their parent, and thus, each strike against a Reconcilant's thick hide breeds more subpuppets to further suffuse the battlefield with their presence. This mix of durability and spawning makes them potent combatants, even though their own attacks are rarely anything remarkable.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Reconcilants are generally very sedate. They spend much of their time resting, or grooming their subpuppets or smaller puppets, licking them clean like some animalian parents. This parental behaviour (along with Hyacinth's own) suggests that the Abomination mind is wired to treat puppets as true offspring, despite their somewhat limblike status.</p>
          <p>Whether they are in or out of combat, Reconcilants radiate a very faint field of healing energy within a short radius of themselves. This field is too weak to have an effect on most creatures - subpuppets are the exception. Subpuppets near a Reconcilant slowly recover from even grievous wounds.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Reconcilants have a fairly small epigenetic profile, which is generally owed to the wide variety of subpuppets they can spawn. It's believed this limited genetic complexity makes them better hosts, as less triggers have to work against the Reconcilant's own. They do, however, sport significantly above-average stem cell levels, making them more readily able to both heal or spawn at a moment's notice.</p>

          <p>Howitzers are specialized heavy artillery in Hyacinth's army. They typically spend most of their time far from the battlefield, pelting targets with incendiary shells. Occasionally, a Howitzer will spawn a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/howitzers/heralds">Herald</a> for support. A group of Howitzers is known as a battery or a stonk.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Howitzers are medium-large puppets, standing taller than <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilants</a> at an average of height of 5' 6" (157cm). They are generally considered smaller than Reconcilants, however, due to their much thinner, ganglier build; many describe Howitzers as the most "horselike" of any puppet. Their distinquishing trait is the trio of elongated, stiffened orifices on their back, which they use for launching incendiary shells resembling typical Abomination pupae. Internally, the Howitzer bears a strikingly robust gas transportation system that it uses to fire its shells, with hardened suture bones allowing the Howitzer to regularly build and release pressures of 60-80 MPa.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Howitzers are deceptively active during combat, mostly due to their inability to focus on moving and shooting at the same time. However, once set up, an individual Howitzer is capable of firing up to four shells in a single volley with rapid accumulation of shells and gas pressure, a Howitzer is capable of reliably hitting point targets out to 200 feet, with a maximum area target range of 500 feet. With a Herald acting as an appropriately near spotter, Howitzers can hit point targets reliably anywhere within their maximum range. The Howitzer's shells contain a thermoactive slurry that rapidly combusts upon contact with air, causing intense thermal damage on struck targets (reaching temperatures hot enough to melt metal).</p>
          <p>Howitzers are less active during peacetime, though they do lend their spatial awareness and planning skills to help other puppets with planning resting areas or any structures they might need. Communing through Heralds, Howitzers can act as a pseudo-telecommunications network, transmitting messages through their bound Heralds to further enhance their planning potential. They can also utilize their launching abilities to transport small packages great distances.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Howitzers, despite their extensive internal uniqueness, combine a strange mix of epigenetic traits from Reconcilants, Totems, and Pustules, in addition to some of their own unique triggers. How exactly a puppet as magically inclined as a Totem fits into the Howitzers' lineage is generally unknown, though some believe the magic is used to enhance their accuracy at great ranges.</p>

          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>With Manipulators and Deltas functioning as the bulk offensive forces of Hyacinth's army, Deltas bring up the rear as support. They produce psionic shields and can incite a powerful psionic aggression in their allies.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Deltas are the smallest of any regular puppet, standing at 2' 8" (76cm), with rather light builds. Deltas have an almost otherworldly slightness to them; they run in long, floaty strides, and their movement produces less noise than other puppets of similar size. They display these traits in addition to an uncanny ability to vault on and balance atop taller obstacles, much like cats. Their defining trait only reinforces this unusual quality: Wispy clumps of thin psionic tendrils that tend to levitate freely in the air, as if weightless. This lightness comes at the cost of their own durability; even most subpuppets outdo their physical endurance. Deltas also display extremely strong psionic potential, resembling an unburdened <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilant</a>.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Deltas are dedicated support units, and rarely approach the front lines if given a choice. They linger behind other, more durable puppets, providing psionic support to their allies. Two main methods of support have been found:<br> - Shielding: Deltas can produce psionic shields around their allies. The shields are form-fitted to the skin, and seem to act as a direct extension of the target's body, absorbing blows as if it were extra hide or flesh.<br> - Aggression: Deltas can produce a powerful, but regulated burst of aggression in their allies. There have been two observed "strengths" of this support: One short-lived, precise boost, generally only affecting one action; and a much heavier dose that leaves an effect for multiple actions. In the case of the second strength, two Deltas will occasionally unleash the same effect on one target, enhancing their vigor further.</p>
          <p>Outside of combat, Deltas commonly flit around their allies, attempting rudimentary first aid to help with wounds or sickness. They can be found licking other puppets' wounds, fashioning simple bandages or splints out of their psionic fields, and such. Deltas also display the flexibility of their psionic fields during peacetime, using them to manifest simple equipment like planes or straight edges to help with physical labour.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Deltas have an interesting mix of distinct and generic triggers. They share a number of triggers found commonly across other puppet types, but also have a number of triggers found in them and nowhere else. It is generally believed that their powerful psionic abilities are both the beneficiary and explanation of the odd mix of common and rare traits.</p>

          <div><h1>Overview</h1></div>
          <p>Praetors are massive superheavy puppets that acty as elite frontline soldiers. They are massively durable and flexible (the latter of which is possible thanks to their three detachable tentacles), with powerful poison that can break down nearly anything. A group of Praetors is known as a guard, or in some circles, an omen.</p>
          <div><h2>Physical Description</h2></div>
          <p>Praetors are colossal puppets, like all superheavies. They stand at a whopping 7' 2" (218cm), and have a considerably heavy build (thinner than a <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/reconcilants">Reconcilant</a>, but not by much). Numerous lumps cover their torso, and they boast three large tentacles tipped with stingers. Each tentacle is capable of stretching to 30 feet long, and the Praetors can detach their tentacles on small portals, allowing them to move freely in a distance around the Praetor. Praetors have innumerable redundant organs, rendering them extremely durable against almost all forms of attack.</p>
          <div><h2>Behaviour</h2></div>
          <p>Praetors are beastly opponents in combat, designed to fend off scores of enemies all on their own. Their raw durability alone greatly exceeds that of a Reconcilant, and their three tentacles are capable of a variety of sweeping and stabbing attacks. Additionally, if a tentacle manages to hook into a target, it can siphon their bodily fluids, providing the Praetor's body with a source of rapid, on-the-spot recovery. A Praetor's weakness is the fragility of the portals it moves its tentacles around on: If a detached tentacle is caught in an anti-magic field, the tentacle will be instantly severed and destroyed.</p>
          <p>If a Praetor's physical strength is not enough, its tentacles can exude a powerful, otherworldly poison. This poison is not especially strong compared to the Praetor's raw damage potential, but is toxic enough to cause contact damage with machines or inanimate object (even withering and cracking ceramic or glass tile). An aggravated Praetor will not resist using its poison to its fullest extent.</p>
          <p>Praetors, true to their name, act as stoic royal guards even when not in combat, though they will occasionally help smaller puppets out with heavy labour activities such as plowing fields or heavy lifting during construction. It is an ample use of the Praetor's strength, though they display a wary protectiveness over the puppets they're chaperoning. It is rare for a Praetor's gaze to be entirely still.</p>
          <div><h2>Genetic Description</h2></div>
          <p>Praetors share some common size genes with other superheavy puppets, and they share some portal magic with <a href="https://aviangeneticist.github.io/hyacinthdirectory/puppets/anchorages">Anchorages</a>. Praetors are unique among large puppets in their complete lack of support for subpuppets, and these traits are appropriately represented in the epigenetic triggers they do not use. The genes for a Praetor's poison glands boast the most robust set of epigenetic triggers of any puppet tissue.</p>

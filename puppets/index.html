            <p>Puppets are semi-independent creatures spawned by Hyacinth in states of duress (most commonly as a response to physical pain). While puppets appear to be entirely separate from Hyacinth in physical space, they are connected by a powerful psionic bond that leaves them in a state of neurological dependence on Hyacinth directly. As such, a puppet's state of being is reliant on Hyacinth's: If Hyacinth is asleep, for example, all their puppets are asleep. If Hyacinth were to die, all their puppets would also die. In this way, they are closer to limbs than independent entities, although puppets do display independent traits when idling.</p>
            <p>Puppets come in several different categories with wildly varying traits and abilities. Their sizes also vary quite a bit as well, ranging from barely pony sized Deltas to towering Praetors that nearly match Hyacinth themselves. The most general grouping of puppets is largely by their 'psionic weight'; that is, the amount of psionic impulses they trade with Hyacinth on a usual basis. Psionic weight can be grouped together in three major categories: Superheavy, Heavy, and Light.</p>
